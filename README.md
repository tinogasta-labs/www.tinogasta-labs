## Icons

This template uses SVG sprites for optimal icon performance, powered by
[vite-plugin-icons-spritesheet](https://github.com/forge-42/vite-plugin-icons-spritesheet/tree/main).

#### Icons Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resources/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ icons/        # Raw SVG icons
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Icon.tsx  # Icon component
```

#### Adding New Icons

Using [Sly CLI](https://sly-cli.fly.dev/):

```
npx @sly-cli/sly add @radix-ui/icons avatar pencil-1
```

The SVG files will be automatically added to `./resources/icons/`.

> You can also manually add SVG files to the `./resources/icons/` directory.

### Using Icons in Components

Icons are automatically compiled into a sprite and TypeScript types are
generated. Use them in your components like this:

```astro
---
import Icon from '~/components/ui/Icon'
---

<Icon name="avatar" class="size-5" />
```
